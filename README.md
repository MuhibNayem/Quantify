- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Cache & Job Queue:** Redis
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ for asynchronous task processing
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication
- **API:** A versioned RESTful API (`/api/v1`)

## API Documentation

The API is documented using the OpenAPI specification. The `openapi.yaml` file can be found in the `backend/api` directory.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Quantify backend, you will need to have Go, Docker, and Docker Compose installed.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantify.git
   ```
2. **Set up the environment:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`.
   - Update the `.env` file with your local configuration for the database, Redis, and other services.
3. **Run the application:**
   - Use Docker Compose to build and run the services:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
   - The backend server will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running the Backend

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API using a tool like Postman or by running the frontend application. The API endpoints are available under the `/api/v1` path.
