# Understanding Your Business Reports: A Simple Guide

Hello! This guide is here to help you understand the business reports you see in Quantify. Think of these reports as your business's health check-up. They tell you how well you're doing, where you can improve, and how to make smarter decisions.

Let's break them down in simple terms.

## 1. The Sales Report: "How much money are we making?"

Imagine you have a lemonade stand. The Sales Report is like counting all the money you've made from selling lemonade at the end of the day.

*   **What it tells you:** This report shows you the total amount of money you've earned from sales over a specific period (like a day, a week, or a month). It also shows you which of your products are the most popular (e.g., "You sold more strawberry lemonade than regular lemonade!").

*   **Why it's important:** It helps you understand if your sales are growing or shrinking. If you see a big spike in sales on a particular day, you can ask "Why?" Maybe it was a sunny day, or perhaps you had a special offer. This information helps you plan for the future.

*   **How we calculate it:** We simply add up the selling price of every item you've sold in a given period.

## 2. The Inventory Turnover Report: "How fast are we selling our stuff?"

Imagine you own a small grocery store. You have a shelf full of milk cartons. The Inventory Turnover Report tells you how quickly you sell all the milk on your shelf and have to restock it.

*   **What it tells you:** This report measures how many times you've sold and replaced your entire inventory over a period. A high turnover means you're selling things quickly. A low turnover means things are sitting on your shelves for a long time.

*   **Why it's important:**
    *   **Fast Turnover:** This is usually good! It means your products are in high demand, and you're not tying up your money in stock that isn't selling.
    *   **Slow Turnover:** This could be a warning sign. It might mean you have too much stock, or you're selling products that nobody wants. Old stock can also expire or go out of fashion.

*   **How we calculate it:** We use a standard formula: `Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value`.
    *   **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** This is the total cost of all the products you've sold.
    *   **Average Inventory Value:** This is the average value of all the products you had in stock during that period.

In simple terms, we're comparing how much you've sold to how much you typically keep in stock.

## 3. The Profit Margin Report: "How much are we *really* making on each sale?"

Let's go back to the lemonade stand. You sell a cup of lemonade for $2. That's your **revenue**. But it costs you $0.50 to make that cup of lemonade (for the lemons, sugar, and the cup). Your **profit** is the $1.50 you have left over. The Profit Margin Report focuses on this profit.

*   **What it tells you:** This report shows you what percentage of your revenue is actual profit. A 75% profit margin on your lemonade means that for every $1 you earn, you get to keep 75 cents as profit.

*   **Why it's important:** It's the true measure of your business's profitability. High sales are great, but if your profit margin is very low, you might not be making much money. This report helps you price your products correctly. If your margin is too low, you might need to increase your prices or find cheaper suppliers.

*   **How we calculate it:** We use another standard formula: `(Total Revenue - Total Cost) / Total Revenue`.
    *   **Total Revenue:** The total selling price of all the products you've sold.
    *   **Total Cost:** The total purchase price of all the products you've sold.

This gives you a percentage that shows how profitable your sales are.
