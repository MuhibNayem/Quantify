## 🛍️ Sales & Staff Reports

### 1. Peak Hours (Heatmap)
**What it is:** A visual grid showing your busiest times of the week. Darker blue squares mean higher sales.
**Purpose:** To help you schedule staff efficiently. You don't want 5 cashiers on a slow Tuesday morning, nor do you want 1 cashier during the Friday evening rush.
**Example:** The map shows deep blue on **Fridays at 6 PM**. You decide to schedule your two fastest cashiers for that shift to prevent long lines.

### 2. Top Staff (Employee Performance)
**What it is:** A leaderboard showing which employees have processed the most sales revenue and the number of transactions they've handled.
**Purpose:** To identify your top performers for rewards and those who might need more training.
**Example:** You see **Sarah** has $50,000 in sales but only 10 transactions (high value items), while **Mike** has $10,000 sales but 500 transactions (fast cashier). Both are valuable in different ways.

### 3. Category Breakdown
**What it is:** A summary of which product categories (e.g., Electronics, Groceries, Clothing) are generating the most money and which have the best profit margins.
**Purpose:** To understand what *type* of products fuel your business. High revenue doesn't always mean high profit.
**Example:** "Electronics" has huge sales ($100k) but thin margins (5%), while "Accessories" has lower sales ($20k) but huge margins (60%). You might decide to promote Accessories more aggressively.

### 4. Frequency Analysis (Market Basket Analysis)
**What it is:** Discovering which products are frequently bought **together** in the same receipt.
**Purpose:** To optimize store layout and create bundle offers (Cross-selling).
**Example:** The report tells you that **Spaghetti** and **Tomato Sauce** are bought together 85% of the time. You place a display of premium Parmesan cheese right next to them to tempt shoppers to buy a third high-margin item.

### 5. Customer Insights
**What it is:** Identifies your biggest spenders and customers who haven't visited in a while ("Churn Risk").
**Purpose:** To build loyalty and win back lost customers.
**Example:** You see **Mr. Khan** used to spend $500/month but hasn't visited in 60 days. You send him a "We Miss You" coupon for 10% off his next shop.

## 📦 Inventory Health

### 6. Stock Aging
**What it is:** A list of products that have been sitting on your shelves for a long time (e.g., > 30, 60, 90 days).
**Purpose:** To identify slow-moving items that are tying up your cash. Cash on the shelf is cash you can't use.
**Example:** You have **50 Winter Jackets** still in stock in April. They have been there for 120 days. You force a 50% clearance sale to free up space for Summer inventory.

### 7. Dead Stock
**What it is:** Products that have had **zero sales** in the last 180 days (or selected period).
**Purpose:** These are "dust collectors." They take up space and earn nothing. You need to get rid of them.
**Example:** A specific brand of **Organic Kale Chips** hasn't sold a single unit in 6 months. You decide to donate them or discontinue the product entirely.

### 8. Supplier Reliability
**What it is:** A scorecard for your vendors showing their average "Lead Time" (how long they take to deliver) and "On-Time Rate".
**Purpose:** To negotiate better terms or switch suppliers if they are unreliable.
**Example:** **Supplier A** is cheap but delivers late 40% of the time, causing you to run out of stock. **Supplier B** is slightly pricier but is 100% on time. You switch to Supplier B because not running out of stock makes you more money in the long run.

### 9. Shrinkage (Inventory Loss)
**What it is:** The difference between what the computer *says* you have and what you *actually* have (discovered during audits).
**Purpose:** To track theft, damage, or counting errors.
**Example:** The system says you have 100 chocolate bars, but you only count 90. That is a **10% shrinkage**. You might need to install a camera in the candy aisle or check staff bags.

## 💰 Financials & Audit

### 10. GMROI (Gross Margin Return on Investment)
**What it is:** The "God Metric" for retail. It acts as an index score: For every **$1** you invest in inventory, how many **dollars** of profit do you get back?
- **Formula:** Gross Margin / Average Inventory Cost
- **Target:** Generally, a score above **3.0** is healthy.
**Purpose:** To see how efficiently you are using your money.
**Example:** You invest $1,000 in buying **Laptops**. You sell them all and make $300 profit. GMROI = 0.3 (Bad investment). You invest $1,000 in selling **Coffee**. You sell and restock 10 times, making $5,000 profit. GMROI = 5.0 (Great investment).

### 11. Void Audit
**What it is:** A log of every time a cashier deleted an item (Void) from a bill.
**Purpose:** To prevent "Sweethearting" (staff pretending to scan items but actually voiding them for friends) or training issues.
**Example:** You notice **Cashier John** has $500 in voids every Friday Night, while others have $50. He might be giving free food to his friends.

### 12. Cash Drawer Reconciliation
**What it is:** Compares the cash calculated by the POS (Sales - Returns) vs. the actual cash counted in the drawer at shift end.
**Purpose:** To catch theft or miscounting immediately.
**Example:** The register expects **$1,450.00**. The cashier counts **$1,440.00**. There is a **-$10.00** discrepancy. If this happens daily, you have a problem.

### 13. Tax Liability
**What it is:** Shows exactly how much VAT/Tax you have collected from customers.
**Purpose:** This is not your money; it belongs to the government. This report tells you exactly what to set aside for tax season.
**Example:** Total Sales were $115,000. The report shows $15,000 of that is VAT. You know you can only spend $100,000; the rest must be paid to the tax authority.

### 14. Returns Analysis
**What it is:** Breaks down *why* customers are returning items (e.g., "Defective", "Changed Mind", "Wrong Size").
**Purpose:** To fix root causes of dissatisfaction.
**Example:** 40% of returns are for **"Defective Power Banks"**. You realize that batch of products is bad and contact the manufacturer for a refund.
