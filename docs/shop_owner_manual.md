## 3. AI Co-Pilot
Your proactive assistant that works 24/7.

### A. Configuration
1.  **Wake Up Time**: Go to **Settings > System** and set `ai_wake_up_time` (Default: 07:00 AM).
2.  **Thresholds**: Go to **Inventory > Products** to set "Low Stock Levels" for each item.

### B. Daily Workflow
*   **07:00 AM**: AI runs the **Daily Morning Check**.
    *   Scans Inventory & Expiry.
    *   Analyzes Yesterday's Sales.
    *   **Broadcasts a Morning Briefing** to your Dashboard Notifications.
*   **Self-Healing**: If stock hits 0, the AI autonomously drafts a Purchase Order.

### C. Asking Questions
Use the **AI Insight** dashboard to ask:
*   *"How are sales compared to last week?"*
*   *"Draft a PO for 50 units of Milk."*

## 4. Troubleshooting
*   **Missing Reports?**: Check your **Notifications** (Bell Icon) for the daily briefing history.
*   **AI Not Running?**: Ensure the `ai-service` is active and `ai_wake_up_time` is set correctly.
